# Lab 3: Generative AI / Large Language Models

This lab is part of our journey through computational modeling techniques and AI in biomedical and clinical applications. It is designed to give you a comprehensive understanding of how generative AI is transforming society in general and healthcare in particualr and the role it will play in the future of medicine.
