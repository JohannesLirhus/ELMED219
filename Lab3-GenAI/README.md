# Lab 3: Generative AI and Large Language Models

This lab is part of our journey through computational modeling techniques and AI in biomedical and clinical applications. It is designed to give you a comprehensive understanding of how generative AI is transforming society in general and healthcare in particular and the role it will play in the future of medicine.<br>  _update: 2023-12-04_
